File Management
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. WAP to find the size of file without opening the file?

2. WAP to compare the size of two files ,input from command line
               Hint :    ./a.out file1  file2

3. WAP to print the type of given file,input from command line?

4. WAP to compare the ages of two files given from command line?

5. WAP to compare the links of two files ,input from command line?

6. WAP to modify the older file timestamp to that of new file.input given from command line?
              Hint: compare times of 2 files. Use stat() and utime()

7. WAP to search a given file in a given directory?
               Hint : ./a.out test.c  /home/vector/

8. Implement copy command?

9. WAP to see the difference between atime,mtime,utime?

10.  The tee command reads its standard input until end-of-file, writing a copy of the input
              to standard output and to the file named in its command-line argument.
              Implement tee using I/O system calls. By default, tee overwrites any existing file with
              the given name. Implement the –a command-line option (tee –a file), which causes tee
              to append text to the end of a file if it already exists. 
              Implement the -i command-line option (tee -i file),which causes tee to ignore interrupt               
              signals.
