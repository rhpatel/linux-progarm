1. Write a program to execute ls , pwd & cal sequentially

		a) Using system( )
  	        b) Using exec( )
		Hint : use fork().

2. Write a program to execute a command with its arguments given at command line.
    i/p :  ./a.out  ls –l
	   ./a.out cal 2011.

4. Write a program to pass num of commands each seperated by delimiter(,) through command line.
                  I/p :   ./a.out   ls,pwd,cal,date

5. Write a program to execute the no of commands from command line
	a) using system( )
	b) using exec()
        Note : no of new process create must be euql to no of cmd given at command line)

6. Write a program to creat  3 new  jobs , in such a manner that all the 3 new jobs should have common parent.
x------bash
x+1 --- x
x+2----x
x+3---x


7. Modify the above program .So that no two jobs have the common parent.
{each job have different parent).
 x------bash
x+1 --- x
x+2----x+1
x+3---x+2

8. In the above given prog execute ls, pwd ,cal ,date command by x,x+1,x+2,x+3 respectively.

9. In the above program the o/p sequence must be date->pwd->cal->ls

10. In the above program do not use sleep but o/p sequence must be child first & then parent.

11. Write a program to create a three child process from the common parent use random delay between 1to 10 sec in each child. Use the exit value in such a manner so that parent should know the sequence of the child exits.
      Hint : while(wait(&status)!=-1)
		{
		;
		}
12. Modify the above program so that parent will wait uptp child -2 exit.sp after child-2 parent will laso exit and another child become may be in Zombie or Orphan.

13. Write a program to i/p 2 small(1 to 50) integers from command line and add two interger in child process and print the sum in parent process.
