Siganl _Handling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Write a  program to deliver the alarm signal periodically after (n-1)sec from the last  interrupt.

                    Hint : Start first alarm at 10 sec then next alarm at 9sec so on up to n=0 terminate .


2. Create a watch dog timer in parent which should watch T.A.T of its child and terminate the  child.
                  Condition:  The child have random delay(1-10 sec)
                  If the child take more than 5 sec then parent terminate it.
                  Hint : fork(),sleep?(),kill(),alarm().


3. Create a function named “find-isr”,which when calling by passing an interrupt number then it  should inform the action of that signal in current program.
                  Signal action----defaulted
                  o/p->Ignore
   	        	    userdefine.
                  Hint : use signal( ) function to return value.	


4. Write a program to remove the zombie. 
	        Hint : Use SIGCHLD  &signal( ).


5. Write a program to ignore the termination of process when its terminal will close.     
                  Hint : use   SIGHUP signal & signal().

6. Write a program to install ISR(handler) for SIGINT and SIGQUIT . Restore the SIGINT to  default after 3 times occurrence.SIGQUIT to default after 5 times occurrence.


7. Write a program to create 3 child process from common parent use random delay between  1 to 10 sec in each child. Use alarm() in parent in such a manner that 
	          Child1 should not exceeds more than 4 sec. 
	          Child2 should not exceeds more than 6 sec.
	          Child3 should not exceeds more than 8 sec.


8.   Write a Program  parent has to get the data from user and store the data in file.after that 
    	    parent process will  send one signal to child process.child process after receving the 
  	     signal,open the file and convert data to oppsite case and store again in same file.
		Hint : Use pause() in child process.
		       Use signal num 10(usersignal) in parent.
